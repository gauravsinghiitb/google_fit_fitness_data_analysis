# google_fit_fitness_data_analysis
• Analyzed a user’s Google Fit data to uncover patterns in calorie burn, step counts, and walking duration, using
visualizations like regression plots, dual-axis scatter plots, and interactive graphs to derive meaningful insights.
• Conducted data preprocessing, calculated daily user statistics and leveraged libraries like Seaborn, Matplotlib,
and Plotly to identify trends and provide a detailed understanding of user fitness patterns and behavior.
